<h3 align="center">Data Uploading</h3>

| Action | Description | Documents |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Provide Data Ingester Account Details | Open a ticket in the helpdesk, select the "Reference nodes" group (or "Technical support team" if unavailable) and add a request with the title: "Create a data ingestion project in UPV" or "Create XNAT project in HealthRI" (depending on the Reference site), providing the name of the project, the username in EUCAIM who will manage it. An answer will be given soon. | - [https://help.cancerimage.eu](https://help.cancerimage.eu/) |
| Download and install the Data Ingestion tool | Download the Data Ingestion tool for the UPV node and the Clinical Trial Processor (CTP) for HealthRI | - [QP-Insights Uploader](https://bio.tools/qp-insights_uploader)<br>- [CTP](https://gitlab.com/radiology/infrastructure/data-curation-tools/ctp-standalone) |
| Request a user in the Reference node | Choose the reference node where the data will be uploaded (only one):<br><ul><li>UPV (login button, register through LS-AAI and ask for a "Data Ingester" account)</li><li>Health RI</li></ul> | - [Registration of users in UPV-eucaim-node](https://eucaim-node.i3m.upv.es/dataset-service/datasets?invalidated=false), <br>- [https://www.health-ri.nl/en/services/xnat](https://www.health-ri.nl/en/services/xnat) |

| Upload clinical Data | Once medical imaging data is uploaded, you can proceed with the clinical data. If the process of converting the clinical data is expected to be long, we encourage you to create an “image-only” dataset by skipping this step. Use the same tool as before for UPV and XNATpy for Health-RI. Data can be in CSV or JSON. | - [QP-Insights Uploader](https://bio.tools/qp-insights_uploader)<br> - [XNATpy](https://xnat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) |
